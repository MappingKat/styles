# Setup

These instructions will illustrate the steps required to
successfully render custom Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team styles.

This guide assumes that a user has postgis installed and running on
a linux environment. A good guide for getting to this point can
be found at [dbsgeo.com](http://dbsgeo.com/foss4g2010/html/)
