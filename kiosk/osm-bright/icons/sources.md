# Icon Sources

As the number of icons grow, inevitably so will the number of sources from which they derive.

The majority of the icons used in the Haiti Kiosk style come from Brian Qunian's (SJJB Map Icon Set)[http://www.sjjb.co.uk/mapicons/introduction].

A number of icons in Brian's set are derived from the work of the Harpers Ferry Center for the US National Parks Service. Certain icons in the Haiti Kiosk style were generated directly from these (freely available icons)[http://www.nps.gov/hfc/carto/map-symbols.htm]

Finally, thanks goes to Frederic Bonifas, who has donated his time to hand create various specialized icons.
